#Sequencer

Perform a sequence of events at tempo

The tempo clock is MIDI syncable by way of [topaz](http://github.com/arirusso/topaz).  However, [midi-sequencer](http://github.com/arirusso/midi-sequencer) is a wrapper for this gem that adds additional MIDI handling capabilities.

This is used by [diamond](http://github.com/arirusso/diamond)
